        <p class="lead mb-4">Good afternoon, my name is Andrew Cruz and I currently am a full time student at the University of California-Riverside. I am studying Political Science and have goals in becoming a lawyer. I am in the process of changing my major to Business Administration. I plan on attending law school after receiving my bachelors degree in Business Administration. Once I graduate from law school my plans are to get hired as a tax lawyer and gain years of experience before opening up my own law firm. Being a lawyer is something Iâ€™ve always dreamed about since I was young because Iâ€™ve made it a skill and a hobby to defend through argumentative behavior. To be a lawyer requires a lot of dedication and hard work. I grew up watching Law & Order where my interest in law was developed. Not only is arguing to defend a point or to execute one is fun as a lawyer, but knowing the different laws that apply to different regulations is interesting to me.<br><br>

        Growing up my parents always made sure I was busy doing some work; whether it be reading, working, or cooking. I was always on my toes, learning new tasks, and even languages. I speak English, Spanish, I can sign, and partially speak italian. I spent a few weeks in Italy where I was forced to adapt to the language or not be able to participate in any activities. I frequently visit Mexico and Ecuador, and was raised in a Mexican household where the primary language is spanish. Iâ€™ve spent countless summers in Mexico and Ecuador due to the amount of family over there. I have also worked and attended school in Mexico during my time there. I worked for some family herding the cows, plowing the dirt, and tending to the crops. I know that labor work has nothing to do with law but I like to push myself out of my comfort zone to learn new skills and hardships. I feel that the experiences that we go through shape and build who we are. And it could be quite helpful expanding outside of your desired job choice to network and develop new skills.<br><br>

        Aside from my international pickups and experiences I have also worked and done volunteer work here in the states. In high school I did a lot of volunteer work for my school feeding the poor at soup kitchens, cleaning the sides of freeways, and volunteering at a middle school tutoring service. I have also worked alongside my stepdad at his body repair shop fixing cars and painting cars. That job was for a select amount of time until he sold it and began working for a private organization that painted trains and placed the lights and tracks for the automotives. His boss allowed me to mentor longside him where I witnessed first hand how to maneuver around a locomotive and the safety measures taken to make sure all precautions are taken. All these experiences have molded me to become who I am.
